## About app

In this app we are going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with full-on custom styling. It will take inputs from user like gender, height ,weight and age with beautiful interactive UI and will show the calculated result of user with BMI value and whether the person is normal, overweight or underweight.
